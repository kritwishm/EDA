In this repository the first assignment of Educational Data Analytics has been uploaded. The goal is to predict the most likely target value for a 
new sample with 5 features using locally weighted linear regression. For simplicity, most similar 25 training samples have been use(along with their 
weights) while fitting the locally weighted regression curve.
